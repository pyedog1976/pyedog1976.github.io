I'm a third year PhD candidate at the [Australian Institute for Machine Learning](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/), 
fortunately supervised by Prof. Gustavo Carneiro, Prof. Vasileios Belagiannis and Prof. Ian Reid. Previously, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science with First Class Honours at the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/).



:high_brightness: My research interests are in the fields of computer vision,
including uncertainty detection, data efficient segmentation, audio-visual segmentation for
both natural image and LiDAR datasets.
